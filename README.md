# SatoriNotes

## Description
My motivation to make this project was to learn how to make a database and access it to edit it. The reason why I built this is so that I could show off what I learned so I would hopefully get to use my knowledge in future projects. I had already been working on projects on my own before I even started my bootcamp, and I honestly had little clue as to what I was doing (I was watching YouTube videos). This project helped me learn what I had been doing before bootcamp and it also helps me understand concepts that I didn't know before.

## Installation
There is not much of an installation process since you can just visit the deployed app on Heroku, but if you want to look at the code itself, just clone the repo and open your terminal. Direct your path to where you cloned the project and then in your terminal, type "nmp i" or "npm install" and you will install all the necessary packages in order to fully run the project.
